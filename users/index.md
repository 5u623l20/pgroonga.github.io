# Users

Here are PGroonga users.

## Zulip

[Zulip](https://zulip.org/) is a powerful open source group chat. It uses PGroonga to implement all languages support full text search. Because [PostgreSQL built-in full text search feature]({{ site.postgresql_doc_base_url.en }}/textsearch.html) supports only one language at the same time. PGroonga can support all languages at the same time.
