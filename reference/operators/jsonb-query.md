# `@@` operator for `jsonb` type

`@@` operator is a PGroonga original operator. You can use complex condition that can't be written by `@>` operator such as range search. If you know [JsQuery](https://github.com/postgrespro/jsquery), you can understand like "PGroonga provides `jsonb` related search features that are similar to JsQuery with different syntax".
