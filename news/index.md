## 1.0.0: 2015-10-29 {#version-1-0-0}

It's the first major release!!!

You need to run `DROP EXTENSION pgroonga CASCADE`, upgrade PGroonga binary, run `CREATE EXTENSION pgroonga` and create indexes again to upgrade to 1.0.0 from older versions.

### Improvements

  * Propagated double initialization on failing to open database. [groonga-dev,03528] [Reported by Naoki Takami]

  * Supported index only scan.

  * Supported regular expression search by `@~`. [groonga-dev,03563] [Reported by Hiroaki Tachikawa]

  * [Windows] Bundled MeCab.

  * Made `LIKE` with index outputs `LIKE` with sequential scan compatible outputs. It's implemented by using recheck feature provided by PostgreSQL. It means that `LIKE` is slower than `%%` operator and `@@` operator.

  * Supported `ILIKE` with index.
